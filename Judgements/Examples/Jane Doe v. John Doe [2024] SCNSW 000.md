**INTRODUCTION**

[1] This matter concerns a claim for personal injury resulting from a motor vehicle accident that occurred on 11 December 2024. The Plaintiff, Jane Doe, alleges that the Defendant, John Doe, was negligent in his driving, which caused her to suffer significant physical and psychological harm. The Plaintiff claims damages for pain and suffering, medical expenses, and loss of earnings.

[2] The Defendant denies liability, contending that the accident was unavoidable and that any injuries sustained by the Plaintiff were not a result of his actions. The Defendant further argues that the Plaintiff failed to take reasonable steps to mitigate her injuries post-accident.

**CONCLUSION**

[3] Upon review of the evidence presented, including witness statements, expert medical reports, and the relevant case law, I find that the Defendant was indeed negligent in his driving. The Defendant failed to exercise the appropriate care expected of a reasonable driver in the circumstances, which led directly to the Plaintiff's injuries.

[4] In relation to the Plaintiff's failure to mitigate damages, while there is evidence suggesting that her recovery may have been delayed due to non-compliance with medical advice, I do not find this to be a sufficient basis to reduce the Plaintiff's claim in its entirety. The Defendant's negligence remains the primary cause of the injury, and the Plaintiff's failure to follow certain medical instructions does not absolve the Defendant of responsibility.

**ORDERS**

[5] The Defendant is to pay the Plaintiff the sum of one-hundred and fifty thousand Australian dollars ($150,000) in damages for pain and suffering, medical expenses, and loss of earnings. The Defendant is also to bear the Plaintiff's costs of the proceedings.

[6] The Defendant is ordered to surrender his lisence and not operate a motor vehicle for six (6) months.
