**INTRODUCTION**

[1] The Defendant, John Doe, stands trial on charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (Section 59, Crimes Act 1900). The incident occurred on 5 December 2024 when the Defendant, during a heated argument outside a bar, struck the complainant, resulting in significant facial injuries. The Defendant admits to the assault but claims it was in self-defense following a provocation.

[2] The central issue in this trial is whether the Defendant's actions were excessive in the circumstances, and whether the claim of self-defense is substantiated by the facts. The complainant, Mr. Williamson, gave evidence that he did not provoke the Defendant, while the Defendant testified that he acted out of fear for his safety.

**CONCLUSION**

[3] After carefully considering the evidence and the testimonies of both the complainant and the Defendant, I find that while there was an initial altercation, the Defendant's response was disproportionate. The Defendant's use of force in striking the complainant was not reasonable, and his actions were not in self-defense as claimed.

[4] The Defendantâ€™s version of events is not consistent with the physical evidence and the witness testimonies. The Defendant escalated the situation and failed to retreat or de-escalate the conflict when given the opportunity. As such, the claim of self-defense is not accepted.

[5] Accordingly, I find the Defendant guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm as charged.

**ORDERS**

[6] The Defendant is sentenced to 3600 seconds imprisonment, with a permanent conviction on record.

[7] The Defendant is also ordered to pay $2,000 in restitution to the complainant for medical expenses incurred as a result of the injury sustained during the assault.
